This project aims to create an open source throttle for commanding model railways from iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads.

The initial aim is for simple speed, direction, and function control.

As a starting point, the supported connection with a layout must be a LocoNet Over TCP server such as can be provided by running JMRI and published via ZeroConf as a "_loconetovertcpserver._tcp.local." service.
